## Word: Geometry

## Pronunciation
/ˌdʒiːəˈmɛtrɪ/

## Definitions
- **Noun**: The branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relationships between points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional analogs. It deals with shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. For example: "Euclidean geometry forms the basis of our understanding of shapes and dimensions."
  
  - _Phrases_:
    - "Plane geometry" involves the study of two-dimensional shapes like circles, triangles, and rectangles.
    - "Solid geometry" deals with three-dimensional figures such as spheres, cubes, and pyramids.
    - "Analytic geometry" combines algebraic equations with geometric shapes to find lengths, areas, and volumes.

  > Example Sentence (Noun): "The high school curriculum includes algebra, trigonometry, and geometry."

- **Adjective**: Relating to or characterized by the principles of geometry. For instance: "Geometric patterns are often seen in art and architecture."

  > Example Sentence (Adjective): "The ancient Greeks developed a complex system of geometric designs in their mosaics."

## Synonyms
- Geometrical (adj)
- Spatial science
- Math of shapes
- Spatial analysis
- Spatial reasoning
- Surveying (in a broader sense)

## Phrases
- "Geometry class": A course where students learn about geometric principles and calculations.
- "Non-Euclidean geometry": A branch that deviates from the traditional Euclidean postulates, such as spherical geometry or hyperbolic geometry.
- "To apply geometry to solve a problem": Using geometric principles and techniques to resolve an issue, e.g., calculating the area of a land parcel or determining the most efficient packaging design. 

Note: While geometry itself doesn't have direct verb usage as shown in your example format, it's often used descriptively in sentences discussing the application or practice of geometry as an activity or process.
