## Word: Its

## Pronunciation
/ɪts/

## Definitions
- **Pronoun**: Referring to something belonging to or connected with a thing or animal previously mentioned or easily identified. It indicates possession or a relationship of some kind. For example:
  - "The cat licked its paws."
  - "The company decided to change its logo."

## Usage Note
It's important not to confuse "its" (the possessive pronoun) with "it's," which is a contraction of "it is" or "it has." For instance:
- Incorrect: "The dog chased it's tail."
- Correct: "The dog chased its tail."
- Correct (contraction): "It's raining heavily outside."

## Example Sentences
- **Pronoun (possession)**: "The tree lost all of its leaves in autumn."
- **Pronoun (relationship)**: "The book had a beautiful cover, but its contents were even more captivating."

## Synonyms
There are no direct synonyms for "its" when used as a possessive pronoun since it specifically denotes possession by a thing or animal. However, in rephrasing to avoid using "its," one might use constructions like "belonging to it" or "its own":

- The car polished its chrome bumper -> The car polished the bumper that belonged to it.
- The organization changed its policies -> The organization changed its own policies.
