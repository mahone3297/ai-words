## Etymology
The word "December" comes from the Latin word "decem", meaning "ten," and "-ber", which is the suffix for months (like "janu-ber" for January). It reflects the original Roman calendar, where December was the tenth month of the year before the adoption of the Julian and later the Gregorian calendars.
