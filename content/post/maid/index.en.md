Note that the term "maid" when used as a verb is quite rare in contemporary English and may be considered archaic or regional. Its noun form is much more common. In some cases, especially in idiomatic expressions or titles (like 'maid of honor'), its meaning can be very specific and different from the general definition of a domestic worker.
