*Note: The verb usage for "rubber" is less common, and it typically refers to the action of stretching or deforming rubber rather than using it as a verb for greeting. In the context of greetings, the word "rubber" would not be used. For that purpose, synonyms like "greet" or "salute" would be more appropriate.*
