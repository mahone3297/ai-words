## Pronunciation
/comˈpærətɪv/

## Definitions
### Adjective
1. **Comparative form** of an adjective or an adverb, used to compare two things or people, expressing a greater degree or quality than another. It often ends in "-er" (for one-syllable adjectives) or "-more" (for multi-syllable adjectives).
2. **Superlative form** (informal): Sometimes used to emphasize the comparison, even though the proper superlative should be used.

## Phrases
- "More comparative" indicates a higher level of a quality.
- "In a comparative sense" refers to using comparison.
- "He is more diligent than his brother" (comparing diligence).

## Example Sentences
- **Adjective**: "This car is more comfortable than the old one."
- **Adjective (informal)**: "The view from this room is way more breathtaking than last year's."

## Synonyms
- Superior
- Greater
- Higher
- More advanced
- Enhanced

## Comparative Form Examples (with adjectives)
- **Strong**: stronger
- **Happy**: happier
- **Beautiful**: more beautiful
- **Fast**: faster

## Superlative Form Examples (with adjectives)
- **Strong**: strongest
- **Happy**: happiest
- **Beautiful**: most beautiful
- **Fast**: fastest

Note: The superlative forms are usually formed by adding "-est" for one-syllable adjectives and "-iest" for multi-syllable adjectives, or by using "than + the + comparative form" for multi-syllable adjectives. However, informal usage may simplify this rule, as shown in the example above.
