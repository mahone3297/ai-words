Note: As a numeral, "nine" doesn't typically have direct synonyms in the same sense as other parts of speech, but numerals representing the same quantity can be used (such as IX in Roman numerals). When used as an adjective describing a quantity, words like "ninefold" or "nonary" can sometimes serve as alternatives in specific contexts.
