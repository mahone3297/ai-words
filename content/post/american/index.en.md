## Etymology
The word "American" comes from the Latin name for the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who theorized that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were not part of Asia but a separate continent, which we now know as the Americas. The term eventually became associated with the people and culture of the region.
