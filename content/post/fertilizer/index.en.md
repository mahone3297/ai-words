## Additional Information
Fertilizers come in various forms including granules, powders, liquids, and pellets. They can be synthetic (manufactured) or organic (derived from natural materials like animal waste or decomposed plant matter). The N-P-K ratio on fertilizer packaging indicates the percentage of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) present in the product. These elements play crucial roles in plant health: nitrogen encourages leafy growth, phosphorus supports root development and flowering, while potassium improves overall plant vigor and disease resistance.
