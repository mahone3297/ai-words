### Note on Usage
As a verb, "to latinize" means to translate into Latin or adapt something to Latin style, customs, or influences. Example: "The local names were latinized by the Roman conquerors." However, "Latin" itself isn't typically used as a verb in the same manner as "hello" in the provided example prompt.
