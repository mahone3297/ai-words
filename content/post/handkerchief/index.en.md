Handkerchiefs can also be part of idiomatic expressions:
- "To throw in the towel" - meaning to give up or concede defeat, derived from the gesture of throwing down a handkerchief in surrender during a fight or contest.
- "A red hanky in the left pocket" - in some LGBTQ+ communities, it was a discreet signal indicating that the wearer was interested in same-sex relationships. 

However, these idioms don't directly define the word "handkerchief"; they illustrate its usage in cultural contexts.
