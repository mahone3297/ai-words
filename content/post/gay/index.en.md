Please note that using "gay" as a synonym for "homosexual" can be considered outdated or potentially offensive by some, and the preferred terms now include "LGBTQ+" or specific terms like "lesbian," "gay," "bisexual," "transgender," etc., depending on the individual's identity. The use of "gay" to describe something as bright or cheerful may also be perceived as insensitive due to its historical association with LGBTQ+ identities.
