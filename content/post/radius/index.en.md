## Pronunciation
/rɪˈædiəs/

## Definitions
### Noun
1. **Radius** (n): In geometry, a straight line segment from the center of a circle to its circumference; it determines the size of the circle. Example: "The radius of the Earth is about 6,371 kilometers."
2. (Physics) The distance from the center of a rotating body to a point on its edge, measured along a line perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Example: "A bicycle wheel has a small radius, making it easier to turn."

### Verb
- Not commonly used as a verb, but it can be extended metaphorically to mean "extend or refer to the radius of something." Example: "The satellite's orbit was designed to have a large radius around the planet."

## Phrases
- "The radius of a circle" refers to the measurement from the center to the edge.
- "Circular radius" is a specific term for the radius of a circle.
- "Increasing/decreasing radius" describes a change in the size of a circular object.

## Example Sentences
- **Noun**: "The radius of the atom determines its chemical reactivity."
- **Metaphorical Verb**: "The new shopping mall extends its radius to cover a larger area."

## Synonyms
- Diameter (when referring to the full length through the center)
- Circumference (the total length around the circle)
- Span
- Extent

## Antonyms
- None, as radius is not a comparative term (it is a single measurement). However, if referring to a smaller circle within a larger one, the smaller circle would have a lesser radius.
