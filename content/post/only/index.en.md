Note: As an adverb, 'only' can sometimes change the meaning of a sentence significantly depending on its placement within the sentence structure. This is known as 'sentence adverbial use'. For instance, in "I only ate one cookie", moving 'only' to different positions would alter the emphasis: "I ate only one cookie" vs "I ate one cookie only".
