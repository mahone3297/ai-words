## Usage Notes
Dialects are often associated with a specific geographical area, social class, or ethnic group and can change over time due to migration, education, or media influence.

Some dialects may be stigmatized or perceived as less prestigious than the standard variety, while others are celebrated for their unique charm and cultural identity.
