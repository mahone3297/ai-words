## Usage Note
In addition to its temporal usage, "since" can also be used with continuous tenses to express a duration (e.g., "I've been studying since 5 PM"). However, this construction is more common in informal spoken English. In formal writing, it is often followed by a point in time (e.g., "I've been studying since 5 PM last Friday").
