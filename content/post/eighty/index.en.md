Note: As a numeral, 'eighty' does not have direct synonyms in the sense that other words can replace it to mean exactly eighty. However, when used in expressions related to quantity or age, terms like "a score" (meaning twenty) could be used to describe four scores (i.e., eighty), although this usage is less common in contemporary English.
