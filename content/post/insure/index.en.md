Note: The verb 'ensure' is often confused with 'insure', but while 'insure' generally relates to financial protection through insurance, 'ensure' typically means to make certain that something happens or is the case. In some cases, especially in American English, 'insure' may also be used to mean 'ensure'. However, this usage is considered non-standard by some and is more common in informal contexts.
