## Definitions
- **Pronoun**: The personal pronoun 'I' is used by a speaker or writer to refer to themselves as the subject of a sentence. For example: "I am going to the store." 
- **Noun**: In philosophy and psychology, 'I' can also denote the self or ego; the individual's sense of personal identity. For example: "The concept of the 'I' in modern psychology explores the nature of self-awareness."

## Phrases
- "I am" is used to assert one's identity or state.
- "It's me/I" is often used to identify oneself over the phone or when surprising someone.
- "To be oneself" implies being true to one's own personality or character.

## Example Sentences
- **Pronoun (Subject)**: "I finished my homework before dinner."
- **Pronoun (Reflexive)**: "I hurt myself while playing football."

## Synonyms

Note: While "I" doesn't have direct synonyms in its use as a pronoun referring to oneself, other forms such as "me" and "myself" serve related grammatical functions within sentences. However, no single word can directly replace "I" as the subject of a sentence.
