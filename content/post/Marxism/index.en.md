## Further Explanation
Marxism posits that society's progress is driven by material conditions and class struggle. It critiques capitalism, arguing that it inevitably leads to exploitation and alienation. The ultimate goal of Marxism is the establishment of a classless society where goods and services are produced and distributed based on need rather than profit. Key tenets include the labor theory of value, the idea of surplus value, and the concept of historical materialism. Marxism has had significant influence on political systems, academic disciplines like sociology and economics, and global social movements.
