## Idioms
- "As mad as a hatter": This idiom is not directly related to 'kettle', but interestingly, the original meaning of this phrase may have originated from the effects of mercury poisoning among hat-makers which caused symptoms similar to madness; however, a mistaken modern interpretation likens it to the boiling action of a kettle, suggesting uncontrollable agitation or excitement. 

Please note that the idiomatic usage above doesn't directly involve the standard meaning of the word 'kettle'.
