## Notes
The word "a" does not have traditional synonyms since it is an article and serves a grammatical function rather than having a direct meaning that can be replaced by another word. Its usage is fundamental to the structure of English sentences but isn't interchangeable like adjectives, nouns, or verbs would be.
