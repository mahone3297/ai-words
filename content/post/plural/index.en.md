## Usage Notes
- Plurals can be formed using specific rules for nouns in English, such as adding -s or -es (e.g., child → children, foot → feet), irregular forms (e.g., mouse → mice), or different endings for certain words (e.g., man → men, woman → women).
- Irregular plurals, like those mentioned above, are exceptions to the general rule, making them more challenging to learn.
