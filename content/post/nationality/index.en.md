Note: While "nationality" primarily functions as a noun, it doesn't inherently fit into other parts of speech like verb, adjective, adverb, etc., in the same way that "hello" can be used as a noun, verb, or interjection. However, in certain contexts, it might appear in compound forms that function differently, e.g., "nationalize" (verb), "nationalistic" (adjective).
