Note: While "northern" can be used in compound nouns (e.g., "northern lights") or adjectivally to describe things related to the direction or region of the north, it does not function as a noun, verb, adverb, or other parts of speech by itself. It typically modifies another noun to indicate its location or origin relative to the north.
