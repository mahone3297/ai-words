Please note that while 'each' can be seen to function like a pronoun in certain contexts, it's primarily classified as a determiner rather than a pronoun in traditional grammatical categories. It doesn't fit neatly into the typical part-of-speech categories like noun, verb, adjective, etc., but serves as a special kind of determiner that can also act pronominally.
