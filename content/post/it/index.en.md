  - Example: "It seems that he has already left."
- **Demonstrative Pronoun**: Can be used to indicate time ("It's ten o'clock"), weather conditions ("It's snowing"), or distance ("It's far from here").
  - Example: "It's about an hour's drive to the airport."
  
## Phrases

Please note that "it" doesn't have specific synonyms because its role and meaning can vary significantly depending on context. However, other pronouns like "this" or "that" might sometimes substitute for "it" in specific situations, but they do not fully capture the breadth of "it"'s usage.
