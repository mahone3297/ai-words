## Etymology
The word "Canadian" comes from the Latin term "Canadenses," which was derived from the indigenous Algonquian word "Kanata," meaning "village" or "settlement." It was originally used to describe the First Nations people living near the St. Lawrence River. Over time, it became the name for the country and its inhabitants.
