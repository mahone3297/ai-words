## Additional Information
Greenhouses are structures that use sunlight to warm the interior, creating a microclimate conducive to plant growth. They can be used for both commercial horticulture and personal gardening, allowing the cultivation of plants that might not otherwise thrive in the local outdoor conditions. The concept of the greenhouse also extends metaphorically to describe any enclosed system that maintains a specific set of conditions, whether it's for scientific research or discussing the broader environmental impact of certain gases on our planet's climate.
