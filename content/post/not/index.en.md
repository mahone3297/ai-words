## Word: Not

## Pronunciation
/naʊt/

## Definitions
- **Adverb**: Expressing negation, denial, or prohibition. It typically comes before a verb or an adjective to indicate that something is untrue or doesn't happen. For example: "I am not going out today." "It's not cold outside."
- **Conjunction**: Used to introduce a negative clause, often after a negative statement with 'neither' or 'nor'. For example: "She isn't studying French, nor is she studying German."
- **Pronoun**: As part of a compound construction (e.g., 'not only...but also', 'no...not'), it can function as a pronoun, replacing a previously mentioned idea. For example: "Not one person objected to the proposal."

## Phrases
- "Not so fast" - said when telling someone to slow down or wait.
- "Not by any means" - used to emphasize that something is definitely not true or will not happen.
- "Not to mention" - used to introduce an additional point that adds to or emphasizes what has just been said.

## Example Sentences
