## Pronunciation
/pərˈtɪk(ə)lər/

## Definitions
- **Noun**: A small word or phrase that serves as a grammatical element, often functioning without independent meaning, to indicate grammatical relationships or add emphasis to a sentence. Examples include conjunctions, prepositions, and particles like "up" or "on."
- **Adjective**: Referring to a word or part of a sentence that has little or no inherent meaning but contributes to the structure or function of the sentence. It can be used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other particles.

## Phrases
- "Particle phrase" denotes a group of words that includes a particle and its complement.
- "Interruption particle" refers to a particle used to interrupt a sentence.
- "Prepositional particle" is a particle that follows a preposition.

## Example Sentences
- **Noun**: "The prepositional particle 'in' indicates location in this sentence: 'I left my keys in the car.'"
- **Adjective**: "The sentence's emphasis shifted with the use of the particle 'indeed.'"
- **Interruption**: "He interrupted his lecture with a quick 'ahem' particle."

## Synonyms
- None (since particles are specific types of words with unique functions)
- Grammatical marker
- Structural element
- Function word

## Notes
Particles are often considered a part of grammar rather than standalone vocabulary items, as they primarily serve to connect or modify other parts of a sentence. They are not easily replaced by synonyms because their function is integral to the sentence structure.
