## Pronunciation
/miː/

### Note
Me is not typically defined as other parts of speech such as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc., nor does it commonly form part of idiomatic phrases beyond its basic use as a personal pronoun. However, it can be used in compound forms like 'me time' (noun) which refers to a period of time spent on oneself or one's own interests.

## Phrases
- "It's me": Used to identify oneself when answering the phone or knocking on a door.
- "Between you and me": A phrase used to indicate confidentiality when sharing information.
- "To find oneself": A figurative expression where 'oneself' could be replaced with 'me', meaning to discover one's true character or purpose in life. 

## Usage in Compound Nouns and Phrasal Verbs
- **Compound Noun**: "Me time" - "I need some me time to relax."
- **Phrasal Verb**: "Look after me" - "Can you please look after me while my parents are away?"

Please note that while "me" is primarily a pronoun, it sometimes functions as part of a compound word or phrase that may take on different grammatical roles within a sentence.
