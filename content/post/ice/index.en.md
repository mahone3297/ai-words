As an interjection, 'ice' doesn't typically have a standard usage as a greeting or exclamation like "hello." However, in colloquial slang, 'ice out' could be used to mean excluding or ignoring someone deliberately, but this usage is not common enough to be included in standard dictionaries as an interjection.
