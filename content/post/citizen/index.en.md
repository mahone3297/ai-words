Note: The "Verb" definition for "citizen" includes two meanings, but in common usage, it is often associated with the act of becoming a member of a country, rather than greeting someone. If you'd like to separate these meanings, you could consider creating two separate entries for "become a citizen" (as a verb) and "greet someone as a citizen" (as a noun or action).
