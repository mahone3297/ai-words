## Word: Myself

## Pronunciation
/maɪˈself/

## Definitions
**Pronoun (reflexive)**: Referring back to the subject of the sentence, emphasizing that the action is done by the subject itself. It's used when the subject and object of the verb are the same person.

- Example: _I did it myself._
- Phrase: "by myself" meaning alone or without help from others.
  - Example: _I prefer to work on this project by myself._

## Example Sentences
- **Reflexive**: "I decided to treat myself to a day off."
- "I'm going to make a cup of tea for myself."
- "She can take care of herself quite well."

## Synonyms
- Oneself
- Self
- Me (in certain contexts)
- Personal pronoun used for emphasis or reflexive action (e.g., 'I hurt myself', instead of 'I hurt me') 

Note that 'myself' doesn't have direct synonyms as it's a reflexive pronoun and its usage depends on the context where the subject and object of the action are the same entity. However, in some cases, 'me' could be used if the reflexive emphasis isn't necessary.
