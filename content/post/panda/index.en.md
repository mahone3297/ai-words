Note: While the term "panda" generally refers to either the giant panda or the red panda, there isn't a verb form or usage as an adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, pronoun, numeral, or interjection in the same way "hello" does. It is primarily a noun used to denote these specific animals.
