## Word: O'clock

## Pronunciation
/əˈklɑːk/

## Definition
**Adverb**: Used to indicate the time by referring to the hour on a clock face. It's typically used after a number to specify the hour of the day. 

Example: "It's five o'clock." 

## Usage
O'clock is not used as a standalone word but rather as part of a phrase expressing time. It comes from the contraction of 'of the clock', historically denoting that the time was being measured by a clock rather than by other means such as sundials.

### Example Sentences
- "I wake up at six o'clock every morning."
- "The train departs at half past nine o'clock."
- "The meeting is scheduled for two o'clock sharp."

## Phrase
- "X o'clock" where X is replaced by a number (e.g., one o'clock, twelve o'clock) to denote a specific hour in the day.

## Synonyms
Since o'clock is a unique expression used to denote time based on the clock, it doesn't have direct synonyms. However, alternative ways to express the same concept include using numerical expressions like "5:00 PM" or stating "at five" instead of "five o'clock." 

Note: There are no verbs, nouns, adjectives, or other parts of speech associated with "o'clock" as it functions solely as an adverbial modifier in reference to time.
