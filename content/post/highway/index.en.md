## Additional Information
As a noun, 'highway' can also refer to any main road, whether it's part of a national or state system, or simply the principal route through a town or area. It may be distinguished from other roads by its ability to handle high-speed traffic flow and/or by being under the jurisdiction of a higher authority. The term can also carry historical connotations, referring to ancient routes such as Roman highways.
