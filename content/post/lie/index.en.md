Note: The verb form 'lie' can also mean 'lay' in certain contexts (i.e., when referring to placing oneself in a horizontal position), but this usage is less common and sometimes considered archaic or regional. It contrasts with the regular verb 'lay,' which requires an object ("lay the book down").
