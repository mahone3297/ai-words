## Note on Usage
In some cases, "no" can also function as a pronoun, replacing a noun that has been previously mentioned or implied, e.g., "Do you have any siblings? No." Here, "no" serves as a pronoun standing for "no siblings." However, this usage is less common and more colloquial than its use as an adjective, adverb, or noun.
