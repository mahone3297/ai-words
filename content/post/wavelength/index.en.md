## Pronunciation
/ˈwʌvˌleɪd/

## Definitions
- **Noun**: In physics and electromagnetism, a measure of the periodicity of a wave, typically expressed in meters (m) or cycles per unit distance (e.g., cycles per meter, Hz). For example: "The radio signal has a long wavelength."
- **Adjective**: Characteristic of a wave's length; referring to the distance between two corresponding points on successive waves. For example: "The microwave oven operates at a shorter wavelength than visible light."

## Phrases
- "Wavelength of light" refers to the specific length of light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.
- "Long/Short wavelength" describes waves with large/small distances between peaks or troughs.
- "Matching wavelengths" is when two waves have a similar frequency, resulting in constructive interference.

## Example Sentences
- **Noun**: "The scientists adjusted their equipment to match the wavelength of the laser."
- **Adjective**: "The infrared camera can detect heat signatures at longer wavelengths."
- **Comparative Form**: "Visible light has a shorter wavelength than radio waves."

## Synonyms
- Frequency (in the context of waves)
- Period
- Wave length
- Wavenumber
- Cycle length

## Antonyms
- Short wave (for longer wavelengths)
- Long wave (for shorter wavelengths)
