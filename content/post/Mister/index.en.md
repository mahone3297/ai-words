## Phrases

Note that while "Mister" is primarily a noun and a form of address, it doesn't have direct verb or adjectival uses like "hello" does. In its function as a form of address, it may appear within sentences where verbs like "call" or "address" are used, but it itself does not act as a verb. Similarly, it isn't used as an adjective to describe a noun except in certain fixed expressions (e.g., "gentleman" above).
