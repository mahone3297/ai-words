/les/

## Definitions
- **Adjective**: (comparative form of 'little') Indicating a smaller amount or degree. For example: "There are less apples in this basket."
  - *Formal Usage*: When referring to countable nouns, it's often considered more correct to use "fewer" instead of "less." e.g., "Fewer people attended the event this year."
- **Adverb**: To a smaller extent or degree; not so much. For example: "She exercises less frequently now."

## Phrases
- "Less than": Indicating that something is not as much as or not as many as another thing. For example: "I have less than $10 left."
- "No less": Used to emphasize that something is surprising or impressive despite being equal to or similar to what is expected. For example: "She's no less intelligent than her brother."
