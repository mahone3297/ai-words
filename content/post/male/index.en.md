Note: While "male" as a noun usually refers to non-human animals, in informal contexts it can also refer to a human male. However, "man" or "gentleman" are more commonly used in formal or polite conversation. As an adjective, "male" is universally applicable to both human and non-human contexts where the distinction of sex is relevant.
