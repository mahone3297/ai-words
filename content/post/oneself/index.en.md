Note: There isn't a direct synonym for "oneself" because it serves a specific grammatical function. However, in certain contexts where it implies independence or self-reliance, words like "alone", "independently", "personally", or "autonomously" may be used. When referring to a sense of self-worth or identity, terms like "self-esteem", "self-image", or "self-respect" could be considered related concepts.
