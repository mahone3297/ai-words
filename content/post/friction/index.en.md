# Friction

## Pronunciation
/ˈfrɪkʃən/

## Definitions
### Noun (n)
- The resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another due to their roughness or adhesion. It's a force that opposes motion between two bodies in contact. For example: "The car's tires had good grip on the road because of the sufficient friction."
  - *Friction can also refer to the resistance to motion or progress caused by opposition, disagreement, or difficulty. For instance: "There has been considerable friction between management and employees over the new policies."*

### Verb (v)
- (Less commonly) To rub against something else causing friction. Example: "The machine frictions against the belt, causing wear and tear over time."

## Phrases
- "Static friction" refers to the force that keeps an object stationary when a force is applied to it.
- "Kinetic friction" is the frictional force acting on an object already in motion.
- "Reduce friction" is often used metaphorically to mean making a process smoother or less contentious.

## Example Sentences
- **Noun (physical force)**: "The coefficient of friction between the rubber sole of shoes and the gym floor helps prevent slipping."
- **Noun (metaphorical use)**: "Efforts were made to reduce bureaucratic friction within the organization to increase efficiency."

## Synonyms
- Resistance
- Rubbing
- Strife (in the context of interpersonal or organizational conflict)
- Tension (in the metaphorical sense)
- Adhesion (specifically referring to molecular forces)
- Grip (when discussing traction)

Note: There isn't a verb form of "friction" commonly used to describe the action of creating friction; instead, verbs like "rub," "scrape," or "grate" are typically used in those cases.
